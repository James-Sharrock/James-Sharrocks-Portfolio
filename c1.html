<h2> <u><b>Chapter 1 is about algorithms:</b></u></h2>
<br>
<h2>Algorithms are step by step instructions, some are crucial others are not. Humans, and robots, use algorithms for daily life. For example,
a person may use algorithms for waking up in a morning and deciding whether to take an umbrella with them to work or not. This means they will 
so something in a set order than can change based on the weather for example or other things that can influence which desicion is made.
</h2>
<br>
<h2>Algorithms can be structured before coding by using flowcharts and pseudocode. However all algorithms will usually contain Iteration, Selection and Sequence:
<br></br>
Sequencing: This means that a computer will run your pseudocode in order, one line at a time from the top to the bottom of your program. Or from box to box when in flowcharts. 
It will start at line 1(box1), then execute line 2(box2) then line 3(box3) and so on till it reaches the last line of your program.
Selection: Sometimes you only want some lines of code(boxes) to be run only if a condition is met, otherwise you want the computer to ignore 
these lines(boxes) and jump over them. This is achieved using IF statements. e.g. If a condition is met then lines 4, 5, 6 are executed 
otherwise the computer jumps to line 7 without even looking at line 4,5 and 6.
Iteration: Sometimes you want the computer to execute the same lines of code several times. This is done using a loop. 
 Thatâ€™s handy as it enables you not to have to copy 
the same lines of code many times. For flowcharts it means that a compter will see if the condition is met if not it will keep re-running he program.</h2>

<h2>In flowcharts and pseudocode input and output is needed for a program to do anything at all. For example if you do not tell the computer what to do 
then it cannot 
do anything. This is achieved by in flowcharts having an input box shaped like a parallelogram that will store and assign values to variables. In pseudocode this is done 
by using brackets and speech marks to input your code. For example, width is the variable here you want to assign a value. width = input("Please enter the input here")  
When something is typed in the box it will assign that value to width.
In flowcharts output is in a parallelogram also and is done by asking the computer to do something with either a variable or a constant. For example: print width could 
be in the output box. In pseudocod this is done in almost the same way but depends how you want to output this. The most common way is to used the operator Print() this 
can be done as : Print("width") and the value of width will show up on the screen.
</h2>
<br></br>
<h2>Variables and constants can both be assigned values but only a variable's value can be changed during the normal execution of a program. 
A constant's value stays constant and will not change while the program is running. Variables and Constants ust be named in specific ways for them to work. For example:
1: Variables and constants cannot have spaces to work. To understand what the variable is called without spaces developers use Camel case and snake case: Camel case 
looks like this: thisIsAVariableUsingCamelCaseAsYouCanSeeApartFromTheFirstLetterOfTheFirstWordTheBeginningLettersOfEveryWordAreCapitalsAndCanBeUnderstoodEasily.
Snake case looks like this.
this_is_a_variable_and_has_underscores_in_between_every_word_so_there_are_no_spaces_yet_you_can_understand_this_really_easily
2: Variables can also not be named after a specific function already in the program. For example in python there is a function called print that we 
have already looked at. If you call a variable or constant print it cant work because this is already in the computers memory.
<br></br>
 There are 3 main types of operators, arithmetic, relational operators and boolean operators
Arithmetic operators are things such as + and - where numerical values are inputted and numerical values are returned after.</h2>
